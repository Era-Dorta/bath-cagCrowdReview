\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

%Include why crowd simulation is interesting in films and videogames????
Crowds are encountered frequently, be it a large number of people in big shopping area, on a popular sports event, or at a demonstration.
While also other types of crowds are also common, such as schools of fish or flocks of birds.
While motives for simulating them range from: \textit{film industry} where it is not always possible or economically viable to have a real crowd,also in \textit{video games} as the game world might have need for a crowd, including \textit{disaster prevention and management} where they are used to aid in the decision making process as they provided a new source of data.

A crowd is much more than the collections of individuals that form it.
And as such the behaviour of the individuals could be affected by other members of the crowd.
History shows how in some cases crowd of people behave in a well organized manner, while in others its individual act selfishly abandoning all social norms.
When simulating this interactions with a naive approach, as the numbers of individuals in the crowd increase the computational cost of the interrelations calculation increments exponentially.

This problem has actually a number of clearly differentiated areas.
Firstly there is a \textit{crowd generation} problem, a modeller needs user-friendly tools in order to set up a scene in which a crowd is present.
Secondly the crowd is an evolving entity, so a \textit{crowd dynamics model} is required to govern the state of the crowd over time.
Thirdly, the model should be presented to the user, so a \textit{rendering} stage is needed.

Crowd simulation and rendering has been an active research area as early as 1987 with a simulation of flocks of birds by \cite{Reynolds1987}.
The author proved that a coherent global behaviour could be achieved by implementing a number of local rules in each entity.

\section{Classifications}

A clear line can be drawn between real-time simulation (games) and non real-time simulation (films).
Since the requirements for each simulation are quite different and so are the techniques used in each area.
However, with such a broad area, a more detailed exploration is required.
Consequently, each of the stages defined in section~\ref{intro} will be treated independently.

\subsection{Modelling Classifications}
\label{subsec:ModelClassification}

In order to simulate crowd behaviour a number of approaches have been proposed.
As they share certain similarities, they can be divided using a common criteria such as the simulation time  and the size of the modelled crowd.
Regarding time, we have short-term simulations, medium-term simulations and long-term simulations.
While in terms of size, a distinction can be made among small, medium and big size crowds.
The type of model used for the agents in the crowd can also be used as a criteria.
Therefore there are \textbf{entity based} simulations, where all individuals are homogeneous, or \textbf{agent based} simulations, where each individual is intelligent and autonomous.

Generally, agent based or entity based systems are used for small and medium crowds.
While for big size crowds, due to their challenging nature, \textbf{flow based} simulations are adopted as the most common approach.

\subsection{Rendering Classifications}
\label{subsec:RenderingClassification}

The different types of rendering techniques can be classified in the following groups.
\textbf{Dynamic mesh decimation}, progressive meshes are used to obtain a coarser representation of the model mesh,~\cite{Hoppe1996}.
\textbf{Dynamically generated impostors}, this procedure involves displaying 2D billboards with fixed poses instead of the full model,~\cite{Aubel2000}.
\textbf{Point-rendering} techniques build multi-resolution representations using point samples from the mesh,~\cite{Wand2002}.

\section{Generating Crowds}

Before the crowd can be simulated or rendered it has to be generated.
Unfortunately, this task has not been researched as deeply as the rest.
This step essentially involves defining the initial parameters at which the crowd operates.
For example, crowd size, goals, ..., and can also include visual parameters such as color or models for the agents.

\cite{Ulicny2004} proposed a brush metaphor to manipulate crowds.
The author technique provides tools for the user in the form of a brush operator(create individuals, change color, etc) and then the user can apply them in the crowd world space.
Edited individuals in the crowd will be those in sight in the screen domain.
Therefore an intuitive approach is provided, as it is similar to what users as used to.
However it has certain limitations, such as lack of direct control over crowd behaviour or difficulty to select individuals in cluttered environments.

Some of the shortcomings of the previous work were met by \cite{Jordao2014}, whose method introduced the concept of crowd patches.
Such patch areas define the crowd behaviour and can be edited through a sculpting metaphor, while also addressing the problem of populating vast empty areas efficiently.
What is more, crowd motion can be modified on the fly as the patches are editable in real time.
%Or the high level of control is provided through to uses of patches????

\section{Simulating Crowds}

As stated in section~\ref{intro}, following a naive approach leads to intractable computing times in simulations that handle more than a small sized crowd.
Below we describe in detail the approaches mentioned in section~\ref{subsec:ModelClassification}. 

\subsection{Entity Based}

\cite{Helbing2000} presented a model where individuals are represented as particles with velocity, mass and forces.
All individual goals are encoded as values in such components.
The model was created to simulate pedestrians in panic situations.
\cite{batty2003} introduced a similar pedestrian model although aimed at simulating carnivals and parades.
The author's model is based on a cellular automata, where an agent step is encoding as moving from the current cell to a neighbour cell.
This technique is constrained to evaluating safety policies and it only has an offline work mode.

\subsection{Agent Based}

\cite{helbing2002} did a complete study of a broad range scenarios in crowd behaviour, with special attention at panic versus not panic crowd behaviour.
For all the situations a common pedestrian model was derived.
\cite{raupp2001} presented a three fold approach to agent based simulations: scripted behaviours, behavioural rules, with events and reactions, and external controls to guide the behaviour.
Controlling the complexity of the behaviours by group settings provides a flexible framework for crowd editing.
More recent techniques add a counterflow paradigm, where agents not only take into account trail formation but also collision avoidance, \cite{heliovaara2012}.
Previous methods create unrealistic jams and collision in counterflow situations.
However this technique is able to solve them successfully.
Nevertheless, this model is still quite simplistic......, real-time or not real-time???

\subsection{Flow Based}

\cite{hughes2003} proposed a flow model method to simulate large crowds behaviour based on intelligent fluid flow.
An intelligent fluid tends to prefer certain paths, i.e. avoiding excessive congestive areas, achieving a more complete model for pedestrian simulation.
However, it would not take into account crowd flow in the individual speeds, therefore preventing lane formation. 
The previous model was improved by \cite{treuille2006} with the addition of continuum dynamics.
Fixing the afore mention problems as well as undesirable oscillations in Hughes's model. 

\subsection{Hybrid Models}

\cite{Narain2009} presented a agent-fluid hybrid model.
Each agent has a preferred velocity and path, however on densely populated regions an incomprehensibility flow factor comes into play.
This factor acts by preventing agents from packing together too closely.
More recently \cite{lin2014} proposed also an agent-fluid hybrid solution to long-range collision avoidance.
When the density is below a certain threshold a discrete collision avoidance is used,
while after the threshold a fluid based lookahead algorithm controls the behaviour.
This technique shows advanced complex behaviour, such as a bigger group splitting in two to make space for a smaller group to go through it.

\section{Rendering Crowds}

The main obstacle to overcome with crowd rendering is how to simplify the scene in order to be rendered in real or feasible time.
Hence, the goal in the following techniques is to reduce the computations in the rendering stage.
A common approach consist of applying a model complexity reduction that is still visually unnoticeable.
Bellow, we present in more detail the techniques commented in section~\ref{subsec:RenderingClassification} that are used to solve this issue.

\subsection{Dynamic Mesh Decimation}

Progressive meshes were introduced by~\cite{Hoppe1996} as a compressed alternative to traditional meshes.
However, progressive meshes can be used as a coarser visual representation.
Provided that the decimation calculation is smaller than the total gain, there will be an increase in rendering performance.
Yet, the procedure has it's limits if rendering quality is to be maintained.
Building on Hoppe's work, \cite{Hu2009} proposed a GPU implementation for progressive mesh refinement.

%Notes for the future, change to something better
They never compare with other implementations, neither CPU or GPU.
It looks like their code is not optimized and they only wanted to prove feasibility of the implementation. 

\subsection{Dynamically Generated Impostors}
\label{subsec:DimGenImpostors}

Impostors are 2D pre-computed billboards used in place of the full 3D mesh model, thus reducing the cost of the rendering stage, as shown by~\cite{Aubel2000}.
However, when an impostor is rendered to an area larger than the impostor resolution, pixels from the impostor texture become noticeable.
~\cite{Millan2006} presented a GPU impostor implementation, which also used pseudo-instancing for further performance gains~\cite{zelsnack2004glsl}.
More recent advances were made by~\cite{Ghiletiuc2013} with a client-server impostor implementation in mobile devices.
Nevertheless, the bulk of the computation was still performed on the server side.

\subsection{Point-Rendering}

Point rendering uses a point cloud subset from the mesh model to reduce the complexity of the individuals in the crowd.
Using less points as the model moves further away from the camera.
\cite{Wand2002} showed that by using multi-resolution point sample rendering in key frame animations, the rendering time becomes independent from the complexity of the geometric model.
~\cite{Larkin2010} presented a point-rendering method that achieved real-time rendering by limiting the resources of the whole crowd, and sharing them with a level of detail value determined by a Delaunay triangulation. 
Each vertex in the triangulation has a density value that is used to calculate the number of points to render.
With small and medium crowds this technique works reasonably well.
However, with very large crowds the resources allocated for each instance might be too scarce.

\subsection{Achieving Variety}

There have been research into applying color variety, height change, accessories, animation variety to copies of individuals.
Since it is an inexpensive method to have a varied crowd.
Moreover, they rely on instancing, which is desirable as discussed in section~\ref{subsec:DimGenImpostors}.

Crowds in specific situations has been simulated, for example \cite{deHeras2005} worked with a virtual Roman crowd in an urban environment.
In this paper they avoided computing each character’s mesh deformation using a precomputed deformed one for each frame.

- Color modulation
- Texture variation
- Shape deformation
- Outfit creation
- Animation diversity

As well as applying color modulation accelerated hardware on instances of the same individual model.
\cite{ruiz2013} proposed a memory efficient method to generate new animatable characters varying skin color, clothes and body size.

\section{Conclusion}

- Generation is an under-researched area, but crowd brush metaphor solve may of the issues
- Simulation still sacrifices a lot with large crowds -> flow approach
- Agent based simulations are becoming predominant, difficult to find papers with the other paradigms
- Rendering there has a been a lot of work, previous processing in CPU moved to GPU
- LOD techniques quite refined now, a lot of it is automatic, like LOD model generations or edition
