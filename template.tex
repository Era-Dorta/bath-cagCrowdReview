\section{Introduction}

%Include why crowd simulation is interesting in films and videogames????
Crowds are encountered frequently, be it a large number of people in big shopping area, on a popular sports event, or at a demonstration.
While also other types of crowds are also common, such as schools of fish or flocks of birds.
While motives for simulating them range from: \textit{film industry} where it is not always possible or economically viable to have a real crowd,also in \textit{video games} as the game world might have need for a crowd, including \textit{disaster prevention and management} where they are used to aid in the decision making process as they provided a new source of data. 

A crowd is much more than the collections of individuals that form it.
And as such the behaviour of the individuals could be affected by other members of the crowd.
History shows how in some cases crowd of people behave in a well organized manner, while in others its individual act selfishly abandoning all social norms.
When simulating this interactions with a naive approach, as the numbers of individuals in the crowd increase the computational cost of the interrelations calculation increments exponentially.

This problem has actually a number of clearly differentiated areas.
Firstly there is a \textit{crowd generation} problem, a modeller needs user-friendly tools in order to set up a scene in which a crowd is present.
Secondly the crowd is an evolving entity, so a \textit{crowd dynamics model} is required to govern the state of the crowd over time.
Thirdly, the model should be presented to the user, so a \textit{rendering} stage is needed.

Crowd simulation and rendering has been an active research area as early as 1987 with the work on birds flocks by \cite{Reynolds1987}.
There, he proved that by implementing some local rules in each entity a coherent global behaviour could be achieved.

\section{Classification}

A clear line can be drawn between real-time simulation (games) and non real-time simulation (films).
Since the requirements for this two types of simulation are quite different and so are the techniques used in each area.

\subsection{Modelling Classifications}

In order to simulate crowd behaviour a number of approaches have been proposed.
As they shared certain similarities they can be divided using a common criteria such as time of the simulation and size of the modelled crowd.
So, in the time axis we have short-term simulations, medium-term simulations and long-term simulations.
While in the size axis there are small, medium and big size crowds.
We can also use criteria according to the type of model used for the agents in the crowd.

For small and medium crowds \textit{agent based} or \textit{entity based} systems are commonly used.
While for big size crowds the sheer number of individuals makes it impractical, so the preferred method is to use \textit{flow based} simulations.

\subsection{Rendering Classifications}

The different types of rendering techniques can be classified in the following groups: \textit{dynamically generated impostors} first used by  \cite{Aubel2000}, \textit{point-rendering} techniques \cite{Wand2002}, \textit{geometry baking} \cite{Ulicny2004} and \textit{dynamic} meshes \cite{Ciechomski2005}.

%\begin{equation}
% \sum_{j=1}^{z} j = \frac{z(z+1)}{2}
%\end{equation}

%\begin{eqnarray}
%x & \ll & y_{1} + \cdots + y_{n} \\
%  & \leq & z
%\end{eqnarray}

\section{Mayor milestones}

With the advent of programmable GPU there has been a shift of general computation from the CPU to the GPU with substantial increases in performance.

\subsection{Modelling milestones}

\subsection{Rendering milestones}

LOD techniques, impostors, mesh decimation, mesh subdivision, cloth simulation.

In order to lower the rendering cost ~\cite{pratt1997humans} TODO CHANGE TO CITED BY OTHER AUTHOR taken from ~\cite{Aubel1999} used a LOD technique to be able to render crowds, however even though it  achieved real time performance the realism of the models was quite poor.
